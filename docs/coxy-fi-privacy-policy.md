## Appendix C: Coxy Fi Privacy Policy

**Coxy Fi – Privacy Policy**

**Company:** Coxygen Global (Pty) Ltd (“Coxygen Global,” “we,” “us,” “our”)

**Applies to:** Coxy Fi intranet pilot and related interfaces provided by Coxygen Global, including Coxygen/Zonke community services that integrate with Coxy Fi.

### C1. Purpose of This Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how Coxygen Global handles information when you access or use Coxy Fi. Coxy Fi is designed with a privacy-first approach. We aim to minimize personal data collection, avoid storing direct identifiers (such as names, phone numbers, and raw email addresses), and rely primarily on pseudonymous on-chain activity and community credentials for eligibility and enforcement.

This policy is provided for transparency and operational clarity. It is not legal advice and may be refined as Coxy Fi evolves or expands into additional jurisdictions or compliance regimes.

### C2. Key Privacy Principle

Coxy Fi is built to operate without collecting or publishing personal identifiers on-chain. Where a login method uses a primary email address, we do not intend to store the raw email address in a recoverable form. Instead, Coxy Fi is intended to compute a derived identifier (CFDID) using privacy-preserving techniques and strong cryptographic derivation methods, so that a database compromise does not reveal your email address.

### C3. Definitions

1. **CFDID (Coxy Fi DID):** A derived pseudonymous identifier used by Coxy Fi to link credit standing and reputation within a community domain without publishing personal identifiers on-chain.
2. **Domain:** A credentialed community environment (e.g., Coxygen/Zonke) that defines membership rules and provides benefits that may be gated by credit standing.
3. **On-chain Data:** Transactions, addresses, token holdings, and smart contract interactions recorded on the Cardano blockchain, which are publicly visible by design.
4. **Off-chain Data:** Data processed outside the blockchain, such as intranet eligibility records, optional repayment proofs (EFT/eWallet/mobile money), support messages, and device-based security data.
5. **Community Credentials:** Domain-issued membership and learning credentials (e.g., CC-NFT and learning credentials) that support eligibility and credit standing.

### C4. What Information We Process

We process limited categories of information, depending on how you use Coxy Fi.

#### C4.1 Information you provide directly (optional and context-dependent)

1. **Login inputs:** If you use an email-based login experience, you may enter an email address and a PIN/passphrase.
2. **Support requests:** If you contact support or administrators, you may provide messages or attachments.
3. **Repayment proofs (off-chain repayments):** If you repay via EFT/eWallet/mobile money/debit order, you may provide a reference, confirmation message, receipt screenshot, or similar evidence.

#### C4.2 Information generated by the system

1. **Derived identifiers:** Coxy Fi may compute a CFDID and other derived values for account continuity and credit profile linkage.
2. **Credit standing and score signals:** Standing states (Good, Late, Delinquent, Suspended, Reinstated) and related signals such as time-in-domain and credential completion counts.
3. **Risk and marketplace signals:** Offer terms, repayment history, and lender/borrower interactions needed to operate the marketplace.

#### C4.3 Blockchain data (public by design)

When you use Coxy Fi, the blockchain may record your wallet addresses, transaction metadata, token movements, and contract interactions. This information is public and can be viewed by any third party via blockchain explorers or indexers. Coxygen Global does not control the visibility of on-chain data.

### C5. What We Do Not Intend to Store

Coxy Fi is designed so that the platform does not intentionally store or publish:

1. names and surnames as a requirement for using Coxy Fi,
2. phone numbers as a requirement for using Coxy Fi,
3. raw email addresses in a recoverable form in the main Coxy Fi system (where email login exists, it is intended to be transformed into a derived alias/identifier),
4. government-issued identity numbers as a requirement for using Coxy Fi.

### C6. How We Use Information

We use information only for the operation and safety of Coxy Fi and the Domain. Typical purposes include:

1. enabling account access and session continuity within the intranet pilot,
2. computing eligibility and maintaining credit standing and reputation within a Domain,
3. operating the P2P marketplace (creating offers, accepting offers, tracking repayments),
4. resolving disputes and investigating abuse, fraud, or misuse,
5. maintaining security, auditability, and system integrity,
6. complying with lawful requests where applicable.

### C7. Lawful Basis and Consent

Where applicable, we process information based on one or more of the following grounds:

1. **Your consent,** when you voluntarily provide optional information (such as a support message or off-chain repayment proof).
2. **Performance of a service you request,** when processing is necessary to run Coxy Fi functions you choose to use.
3. **Legitimate interests,** when processing is necessary to prevent abuse, protect users, and maintain system integrity, provided those interests do not override your rights.
4. **Legal obligations,** where we are required to comply with lawful requests.

### C8. Disclosure and Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited information only as necessary:

1. **With other users:** Loan-related information that is necessary for a lender and borrower to coordinate may be displayed, but it should remain pseudonymous by design.
2. **Within the Domain:** Credit standing may be used to gate access to Domain benefits, such as training, jobs networks, or positions.
3. **Service providers:** If we use infrastructure providers (hosting, analytics, uptime monitoring) for the intranet pilot, they may process limited technical data strictly for those services.
4. **Legal and safety reasons:** We may disclose information if required by law or if necessary to investigate harmful activity.

### C9. Data Retention

We aim to retain off-chain data only as long as needed for the purposes described:

1. Credit standing and eligibility data may be retained while you remain part of the Domain and while your standing needs to be enforced.
2. Off-chain repayment proofs, if used, may be retained for a limited period to resolve disputes and audit repayment confirmation.
3. Support communications may be retained for quality, troubleshooting, and safety reasons.

On-chain data may persist indefinitely because blockchain records are designed to be permanent.

### C10. Security Measures

We apply reasonable security measures appropriate to an intranet pilot, including access controls, encryption where feasible, and minimization of stored identifiers. Users must also protect their own secrets (wallet keys, PINs, device secrets). If a user loses access to their wallet or secrets, Coxygen Global may not be able to restore access.

### C11. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction and applicable law, you may have rights such as:

1. requesting access to certain off-chain information we hold about you,
2. requesting correction of inaccurate off-chain records,
3. requesting deletion of certain off-chain data (noting that we cannot delete blockchain records),
4. objecting to certain processing or requesting restrictions,
5. withdrawing consent for optional processing.

To exercise rights, users may contact the Domain’s designated privacy channel or administrator process. Because the system is pseudonymous and avoids direct identifiers, we may require proof of control of the associated wallet or Domain credential to process certain requests.

### C12. Cross-Border Processing

If infrastructure or service providers are used across borders, your off-chain data may be processed in other countries. We aim to apply appropriate safeguards consistent with applicable law and reasonable security practices.

### C13. Children and Minors

Coxy Fi is intended for participants who are legally able to enter agreements in their jurisdiction. Where the Domain includes minors, the Domain must implement appropriate guardian/consent processes if required by applicable law.

### C14. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in Coxy Fi, the Domain, or legal requirements. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

### C15. Contact

For privacy inquiries, users should use the Domain’s published privacy contact process. Coxy Fi may publish a dedicated privacy channel within the intranet environment for pilot operations.
