11.2 **No Extortion.** Lenders may not demand additional payment outside agreed terms or threaten Borrowers beyond protocol-defined enforcement.

22.2 **Severability by Jurisdiction.** Any clause that is unenforceable in your jurisdiction shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder of the Agreement remains in effect.

## 23. Dispute Resolution, Neutral Arbitration Seat, and Class Action Waiver

23.1 **Good-faith negotiation.** Before commencing arbitration, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to Coxy Fi, these Terms, any Domain policy, or any interface (“Dispute”) through written notice and reasonable discussion for at least fourteen (14) days, unless urgent interim relief is required.

23.2 **Binding arbitration (administered).** Except where prohibited by mandatory law, any Dispute that is not resolved under Section 23.1 shall be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the **Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)** in accordance with the **SIAC Rules** in force at the time the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. ([Aceris Law][2])

23.3 **Seat (legal place) of arbitration: Singapore.** The **seat (legal place) of arbitration shall be Singapore**. The parties acknowledge that the seat is a legal concept distinct from the venue of hearings and that hearings may occur in any location (including virtually) as directed by the tribunal, without changing the seat. ([LCIA][1])

23.4 **Language.** The language of the arbitration shall be English.

23.5 **Number of arbitrators.**
(a) If the aggregate amount in dispute is **USD 50,000 or less** (or the equivalent), the tribunal shall consist of **one (1) arbitrator**.

23.9 **No class actions / representative proceedings.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, Disputes must be brought in an individual capacity only, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding.

## 24. Governing Law (Two safe options)

A neutral seat does **not** require neutral governing law; they are separate choices. ([debevoise.com][4])
Choose one of these options and keep it consistent across the document:

### Option A (recommended for you): South African governing law + neutral seat

24.1 **Governing law.** This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be governed by the laws of **South Africa**, excluding conflict-of-law rules, except where mandatory law in a User’s jurisdiction requires otherwise.
24.2 **Arbitration seat unaffected.** The seat of arbitration remains **Singapore** as stated in Section 23.3.

### Option B: Neutral governing law + neutral seat (more “globally neutral”)

24.1 **Governing law.** This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be governed by the laws of **Singapore** (or alternatively **England & Wales**), excluding conflict-of-law rules, except where mandatory law requires otherwise.
24.2 **Arbitration seat.** The seat of arbitration remains **Singapore** as stated in Section 23.3.

27.1 **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any Domain policy documents incorporated by reference, forms the entire agreement between you and Coxygen regarding Coxy Fi.
27.2 **Order of Precedence.** In case of conflict: (1) mandatory law, (2) this Agreement, (3) Domain policies, (4) interface summaries.

## 28. Schedules and Jurisdiction Modules (Required for “Global” Use)
