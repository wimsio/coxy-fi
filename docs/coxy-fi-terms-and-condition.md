## Appendix B: Coxy Fi Terms & Conditions

### B1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using Coxy Fi, each participant confirms that they have read and understood these Terms & Conditions, accept them knowingly and willingly, and agree to be bound by them. If a participant does not agree, they must not use Coxy Fi.

### B2. No Financial Advice and No Guarantee

Coxy Fi does not provide financial advice, investment advice, legal advice, or tax advice. No outcomes are guaranteed. Lenders may lose some or all funds. Borrowers may lose access to community benefits if they fail to repay. Participation is voluntary and at the user’s sole risk.

### B3. Eligibility

Borrower eligibility is restricted to Domain members meeting the requirements published by the Domain, including but not limited to minimum enrollment duration and learning credential completion thresholds. Lenders may be subject to separate access requirements depending on the Domain policy.

### B4. Self-Custody and User Responsibility

Users are responsible for safeguarding their wallets, keys, PINs, passphrases, and any device-stored secrets. If a user loses access to their wallet or login secret, they may lose access to funds, credit standing, and community privileges. The platform is not responsible for recovery of lost secrets.

### B5. Privacy and Data Handling

Coxy Fi is designed to minimize personal data usage. Users acknowledge that blockchain transactions are public and that pseudonymous activity may be observable on-chain. Users also acknowledge that off-chain repayment proofs, where used, may contain personal data and should be handled according to the Domain’s privacy policy and operational rules.

The platform shall not intentionally publish names, phone numbers, or email addresses on-chain. Where email-based login exists, the system shall use privacy-preserving derivation and shall avoid storing raw identifiers whenever feasible.

### B6. Lending Terms and Offer Formation

A lender may create loan offers specifying principal, asset type, interest, fees (if any), duration, payment schedule, and eligibility requirements. A loan offer becomes binding only when a borrower accepts it and the corresponding on-chain transaction succeeds. Prior to acceptance, the lender may cancel the offer.

### B7. Borrower Obligations

Borrowers agree to repay principal and agreed interest in the same asset type as borrowed, according to the schedule. Borrowers acknowledge that failure to repay may cause suspension of borrowing privileges and loss of access to Domain benefits.

### B8. Repayments and Confirmation

For on-chain repayments, repayment is complete upon successful transaction finality. For off-chain repayments (EFT/eWallet/mobile money/debit orders), borrowers must submit proof according to published procedures. Lenders must confirm receipt honestly and within the confirmation window where such windows are implemented. Users acknowledge that disputes may occur and that future upgrades may introduce structured dispute resolution mechanisms.

### B9. Late Payments, Arrears, and the “Three Chances” Policy

Borrowers acknowledge that missing due dates may trigger late standing. The protocol provides up to three opportunities to cure arrears within defined windows. If arrears are not cured after the third opportunity, the borrower may be suspended. The borrower acknowledges that suspension includes loss of borrowing privileges and other Domain benefits until arrears are resolved.

### B10. Suspension, Reinstatement, and Reputation

Suspension is a consequence of unresolved arrears and is applied within the Domain. Reinstatement may be possible after arrears are paid in full. Users acknowledge that prior suspension may affect future borrowing terms, eligibility, and lender pricing decisions.

### B11. Fees

Where fees apply (including network fees and any protocol or service fees), they must be disclosed before execution. Users are responsible for all blockchain network fees and any optional service fees they choose to use, such as conversion or cash-out services if offered.

### B12. Prohibited Use and Abuse Prevention

Users may not attempt to manipulate credit standing, falsify repayment proofs, harass other users, exploit bugs, or interfere with protocol operation. The Domain may apply standing penalties or access restrictions to preserve safety of the community and lenders.

### B13. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Coxygen Global (Pty) Ltd, its directors, staff, contractors, and affiliates shall not be liable for any losses arising from use of Coxy Fi, including loss of funds, loss of access, smart contract vulnerabilities, stablecoin risks, or disputes between users. Users accept these risks knowingly and voluntarily.

### B14. Changes to Terms

These Terms & Conditions may be updated. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance of updated terms. The Domain should publish updates transparently.

### B15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

The governing law and jurisdiction clauses should be defined explicitly in the production Terms & Conditions, taking into account the Domain’s operating base and applicable user jurisdictions. This outline does not constitute legal advice and should be reviewed by qualified counsel before public launch.
