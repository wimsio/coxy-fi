## Appendix D: Coxy Fi User Agreement

**Coxy Fi – User Agreement / Terms of Use (Draft)**

**Company:** Coxygen Global (Pty) Ltd

**Applies to:** All users of Coxy Fi and any Domain-integrated services that use Coxy Fi standing for gating.

### D1. Acceptance and Voluntary Participation

By using Coxy Fi, you confirm that you have read and understood this User Agreement and that you accept it knowingly, willingly, and freely. If you do not agree, you must not use Coxy Fi.

You acknowledge that Coxy Fi is an experimental protocol and may be offered initially as an intranet pilot within a Domain. You understand that features and rules may change as the pilot evolves.

### D2. No Financial Advice and No Guarantees

Coxy Fi does not provide financial advice, investment advice, tax advice, or legal advice. Nothing in the Coxy Fi interface, documentation, training, or community discussion constitutes a recommendation to lend, borrow, or invest.

You acknowledge that:

1. lenders may lose some or all funds,
2. borrowers may lose access to Domain benefits for non-repayment,
3. stablecoins may de-peg or fail,
4. smart contract or operational failures may cause losses, and
5. you participate at your own risk.

### D3. Eligibility

Borrowers must meet Domain eligibility requirements. In the pilot, eligibility may include minimum membership duration (e.g., six months), completion of learning credentials (e.g., 37 on-chain credentials), and non-suspended standing. The Domain may modify eligibility thresholds for safety and sustainability.

Lenders may be subject to Domain access rules, but lenders are generally treated as liquidity providers who can participate based on Domain policy.

### D4. Self-Custody and Security Responsibilities

Users are responsible for safeguarding wallets, keys, PINs/passphrases, device secrets, and any access methods used to interact with Coxy Fi. Coxygen Global is not responsible for:

1. lost or stolen keys,
2. phishing or scams,
3. user error in sending assets,
4. misconfigured devices, or
5. unauthorized access arising from weak secrets.

### D5. Formation of Loan Agreements Between Users

Coxy Fi is a marketplace tool that enables direct arrangements between lenders and borrowers. When a borrower accepts a lender offer and the on-chain transaction succeeds, a binding loan obligation is formed between the lender and borrower under the accepted terms.

Coxygen Global is not a lender, not a borrower, and not a custodian of funds. Coxygen Global does not guarantee repayment or enforce repayment through legal collections.

### D6. Loan Terms, Interest, and Disclosures

Lenders set their own terms, including interest rate, duration, repayment cadence, and risk requirements. Borrowers choose which offers to accept.

Before acceptance, Coxy Fi shall aim to display, at minimum:

1. principal amount,
2. asset type (stablecoin or ADA),
3. duration and due dates,
4. interest and fees (if any), and
5. consequences of late payment and suspension rules.

Borrowers acknowledge they are responsible for understanding affordability and repayment ability before borrowing.

### D7. Repayment Rules

Repayment must be made in the same asset type that was borrowed. If a borrower borrows ADA, repayment must be in ADA. If a borrower borrows a stablecoin, repayment must be in that stablecoin.

Users acknowledge that network fees apply to on-chain repayments.

### D8. Off-Chain Repayments and Confirmation (If Enabled)

If off-chain repayment methods are enabled (EFT, eWallet, mobile money, debit order), the borrower must submit proof according to published procedures. The lender must confirm receipt honestly. Users acknowledge that off-chain proofs can be disputed and may be subject to future dispute resolution mechanisms, such as time windows and arbitration processes.

Coxygen Global may suspend users who repeatedly submit fraudulent proofs or who repeatedly refuse honest confirmations, subject to Domain policy.

### D9. Late Payment, “Three Chances,” and Suspension

Borrowers acknowledge that missing a due date may trigger late standing. The protocol provides up to three opportunities to cure arrears within defined windows. If arrears are not cured after the third opportunity, the borrower may be placed into Suspended standing within the Domain.

Suspension may include loss of access to Domain benefits, including but not limited to:

1. further borrowing opportunities,
2. training access,
3. jobs networks,
4. positions or community roles, and
5. other Domain-defined services.

### D10. Reinstatement

A suspended borrower may become eligible again by repaying all arrears and satisfying reinstatement requirements. The Domain may apply score penalties, waiting periods, or lower borrowing limits after reinstatement for safety.

### D11. Prohibited Conduct

Users may not:

1. exploit bugs or attempt to manipulate contract state,
2. falsify repayment proofs,
3. harass or extort other users,
4. impersonate others or attempt to deanonymize users,
5. spam the marketplace with malicious offers, or
6. interfere with Domain operations.

Violations may result in penalties, suspension, or removal from Domain services, subject to Domain policy.

### D12. Fees

Users are responsible for on-chain network fees. If Coxy Fi provides optional services (such as conversion/cash-out processes in later phases), service fees must be disclosed before execution. Users agree to pay disclosed fees when they opt into such services.

### D13. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Coxygen Global (Pty) Ltd, its directors, staff, contractors, community moderators, and affiliates are not liable for losses arising from use of Coxy Fi, including:

1. loss of funds,
2. stablecoin de-pegging,
3. smart contract vulnerabilities,
4. user mistakes,
5. disputes between borrowers and lenders, or
6. loss of access to Domain benefits due to standing rules.

Users accept all such risks knowingly and voluntarily.

### D14. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Coxygen Global and its affiliates from claims arising out of your misuse of Coxy Fi, your violation of these terms, your disputes with other users, or your unlawful conduct.

### D15. Service Availability and Changes

Coxy Fi may be modified, paused, restricted, or upgraded during the pilot. Features may be added or removed. Users acknowledge that system availability is not guaranteed and that upgrades may introduce new risks.

### D16. Termination and Enforcement

The Domain may restrict or terminate access to Domain services for users who violate rules, abuse the system, or create safety risks for the community. Termination of access does not automatically remove on-chain obligations that already exist between lenders and borrowers.

### D17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

The governing law and jurisdiction should be stated explicitly in the production Terms & Conditions used for public deployment. This draft should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel prior to expansion beyond the intranet pilot.

### D18. Entire Agreement and Updates

This User Agreement, together with the White Paper, published Domain policies, and any referenced Terms & Conditions, represents the rules of participation. Updates may occur. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.
